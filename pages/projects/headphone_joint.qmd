## Overview
Hifiman headphones have a reputation for delivering high audio quality at a discount price, but unfortunately, sometimes with discount build quality as well. The joint attaching the driver to the headband broke on my pair of HE-400s just weeks after purchase, and [this Head-Fi forum thread](https://www.head-fi.org/threads/hifiman-he-500-he-as-in-high-end-proving-to-be-an-enjoyable-experience-in-listening.551345/page-1226) shows that these quality control issues are not uncommon across the early 2010s HIFIMAN headphone lineup.

I decided to fix my broken headphones by designing a new enclosure that reinforces the preexisting hardware, and even after years of abuse, the joints have held together strong!

I've attached the STL which can be printed as-is. Also attached is the Solidworks Model Part, so feel free to modify as you like!

<script>
  const container = document.getElementById("stl-viewer");

  const scene = new THREE.Scene();
  scene.background = new THREE.Color(0xf0f0f0);

  const camera = new THREE.PerspectiveCamera(
    45,
    container.clientWidth / container.clientHeight,
    0.1,
    10000
  );

  const renderer = new THREE.WebGLRenderer({ antialias: true });
  renderer.setSize(container.clientWidth, container.clientHeight);
  container.appendChild(renderer.domElement);

  const controls = new THREE.OrbitControls(camera, renderer.domElement);
  controls.enableDamping = true;

  scene.add(new THREE.AmbientLight(0xffffff, 0.6));

  const dirLight = new THREE.DirectionalLight(0xffffff, 0.8);
  dirLight.position.set(1, 1, 1);
  scene.add(dirLight);

  const loader = new THREE.STLLoader();
  loader.load(
    "../../assets/headphone_joint/jointfix_final.stl",
    function (geometry) {

      // 🔑 REQUIRED for many STLs
      geometry.computeVertexNormals();

      const material = new THREE.MeshStandardMaterial({
        color: 0x666666,
        roughness: 0.5,
        metalness: 0.1
      });

      const mesh = new THREE.Mesh(geometry, material);
      scene.add(mesh);

      // 🔑 Auto-center + auto-scale camera
      const box = new THREE.Box3().setFromObject(mesh);
      const size = box.getSize(new THREE.Vector3()).length();
      const center = box.getCenter(new THREE.Vector3());

      mesh.position.sub(center);

      camera.near = size / 100;
      camera.far = size * 100;
      camera.updateProjectionMatrix();

      camera.position.set(0, 0, size * 0.8);
      controls.target.set(0, 0, 0);
      controls.update();
    }
  );

  function animate() {
    requestAnimationFrame(animate);
    controls.update();
    renderer.render(scene, camera);
  }
  animate();

  // Handle resize (important for Quarto layouts)
  window.addEventListener("resize", () => {
    camera.aspect = container.clientWidth / container.clientHeight;
    camera.updateProjectionMatrix();
    renderer.setSize(container.clientWidth, container.clientHeight);
  });
