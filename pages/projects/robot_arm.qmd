## Overview
This project focused on the rapid prototyping of a small-scale robotic arm, including mechanical design, embedded control, and a custom graphical user interface for user interaction and testing.

## System Architecture
- **Mechanical:** 3D-printed arm with multiple degrees of freedom
- **Control:** Embedded controller handling motor commands and feedback
- **Software:** Python-based GUI for manual control and testing

## What I Built
- Designed and assembled the robotic arm hardware
- Implemented embedded control logic for joint actuation
- Developed a Python GUI to command joints and visualize system state
- Integrated hardware and software into a functional prototype
